# Day 1

### Goals

- Implement Layer class and subclasses (InputLayer, DenseLayer and OutputLayer) ✅

### How did it go?

The implementation was conceptually straightforward, so could be completed in a short amount of time.

# Day 2

### Goals

- Implement the Sequential class:
    - Implement the constructor for the Sequential class ✅

### How did it go?

I found this goal quite simple because it was just implementing a constructor, and adding some basic assertions within
said constructor

# Day 3

### Goals

- Implement the Sequential class:
  - Implement the run method ✅
  - Save and load the model ✅

### How did it go?

Implementing the run method was a bit more difficult than the other goals before, because I finally had to start computing activations,
but it was still quite straightforward. This is helpful for then implementing the training method, which is where I
expect this to get much more difficult.

Implementing the save and load methods were quite straightforward.
